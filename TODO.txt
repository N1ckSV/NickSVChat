-LIB has no safety if program exe file using it twice

-change result != EResult::Success to ResultIsOneOf

-GNS has UserData int64 that can be attached to user ID . See SetConnectionUserData
 after some thoughts I came to the conclusion that 
 GNS UserData is only useful if I want to get rid of m_mapConnections

-add all needed methods in IChatSocket

-think about virtual object factory, that making polymorhic objects
{
    factory should be:
        -only once initialized
        -one per Socket
        -const ref gettable
        -global gettable
        -private
}
